Overview: SPX6900, a parody of the S&P 500 hitting “6900,” is the king of Base meme coins, driven by viral memes and whale activity. Its cult-like community and Binance Futures listing fuel its momentum, despite volatility (e.g., a 13% pullback after a 100% surge). SPX embodies internet absurdity, making it a high-risk, high-reward pick for traders.
